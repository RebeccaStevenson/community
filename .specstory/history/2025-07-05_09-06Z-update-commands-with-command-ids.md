# Update commands with command IDs (2025-07-05 09:06Z)

_**User**_

can you update these commands by using the command id instead of the keyboard shortcut?

don't delete the old command with keyboard shortcut just commented out and add in the new command with the command id

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Cursor Updates**

I'm working on replacing the key-based commands in `custom/cursor_mac.talon` with command IDs, as instructed. The old key commands will be carefully commented out. I'm referencing the provided markdown table of command IDs. This is a substantial refactor of cursor management.


**Mapping Key Commands**

I've begun the replacement. I'm taking the key commands like `compose: key(cmd-i)` and cross-referencing them against the command ID table.  I'll replace each key command with its corresponding ID. The existing key commands will be meticulously commented out to preserve them. The initial mapping has started.


**Converting Keybinds to IDs**

I've made great progress on the conversion. I've successfully mapped and replaced commands like `compose: key(cmd-i)` and `chat : key(cmd-l)` with their corresponding command IDs, such as `composer.closeComposerTab` and `composer.cancelComposerStep`. Each replaced command is meticulously commented. I am confident I can finish this refactor today.


**Mapping Composer Actions**

I'm now focusing on the `compose: key(cmd-i)` command.  Given the documentation, it seems to correspond to `composer.startComposerPrompt`. I'll replace the keybind and comment out the old one, and update the table as a reference. This approach seems straightforward. I'll test the command after replacing it.


**Continuing the Refactor**

I've now mapped `compose: key(cmd-i)` to `composer.startComposerPrompt`, and `inline: key(cmd-k)` to `composer.openEdit`, ensuring the old keybinds are commented. Next, I'll address `chat: key(cmd-l)`, which seems to map to `composer.cancelComposerStep`.  I will keep the keybind `ask: key(alt-enter)` as there is no corresponding ID. I'm carefully documenting each replacement.


**Analyzing and Mapping Commands**

I've completed my initial mapping of the commands. I've successfully implemented the switch to command IDs for several key actions such as `composer.startComposerPrompt` and `composer.openEdit`. Additionally, I've left the `ask: key(alt-enter)` command unchanged since I couldn't find a corresponding ID.  I'm focusing now on ensuring the overall coherence of these changes.


**Refining the Command Mapping**

I've completed the initial mapping of many commands, replacing keybinds with their respective IDs from the provided table. For example, `compose: key(cmd-i)` has become `composer.startComposerPrompt`. I've also left `ask: key(alt-enter)` unchanged as there's no corresponding ID.  I am looking into how to call vscode commands in a Talon file.

Of course. I will update the commands in `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to use their respective command IDs instead of keyboard shortcuts.

First, I need to read the `apps/vscode/vscode.py` file to understand how to call Visual Studio Code commands from a `.talon` file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Command Invocation**

I've been examining the `apps/vscode` directory to understand how to call VS Code commands via their IDs from a `.talon` file. The aim is to move away from direct keybindings in `custom/cursor_mac.talon`. I'm focusing on the interaction of Talon and VSCode to establish the mechanism for invoking commands with their identifiers.


**Exploring Command Invocation**

I'm now reading the first 500 lines of `apps/vscode/vscode.py`. I've realised my previous attempt at accessing the file was incorrectly implemented. I am hoping this will provide insight into how Talon communicates with VS Code and allows command ID invocation. This updated approach focuses on a detailed examination of the `vscode.py` file to find clues about command execution.


</details></think>

---

My apologies. I made a mistake in my previous attempt to read the file. I will now read `apps/vscode/vscode.py` to see how to call commands by their ID.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Command Definitions**

I've examined `apps/vscode/vscode.py`. The command-calling action isn't directly defined. Instead, it seems to rely on an action named `user.vscode`. My focus now shifts to locating where this `user.vscode` action is defined. Finding its definition is crucial to understanding the workflow.


**Tracing Action Definitions**

I've been tracing the `user.vscode` action, and it hasn't popped up in `apps/vscode/vscode.py`. I then shifted my attention to `apps/vscode/vscode.talon`, as it could hold the key. My intuition paid off. I'm now certain this is where I'll find the definition for `user.vscode` and further unravel the command execution mechanism. This should lead me straight to the root!


</details></think>

---

I've reviewed `apps/vscode/vscode.py` and see it uses `actions.user.vscode(...)` to execute commands. The definition for this action isn't in this file, so I'll now examine `apps/vscode/vscode.talon` for more clues on how these commands are implemented.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Mapping Command IDs**

I've confirmed `user.vscode("COMMAND_ID")` is the key for command execution. Currently, I'm diligently mapping commands from `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to corresponding IDs gleaned from the markdown file. This process is crucial to bridge the gap between spoken commands and precise VS Code actions.


**Identifying Command Relationships**

I've made headway in mapping commands, using the markdown as my guide. I've successfully linked "compose" and "chat open" to `composer.startComposerPrompt`. I'm still working on "chat," pondering its relationship with `composer.openAsPane` given its keybinding. I've also left "compose full" unmapped for now as it doesn't appear in the documentation.


**Connecting Keybinds to Commands**

I've further refined my mapping, focusing on command IDs and keybindings. I've successfully associated "compose" and "chat open" with `composer.startComposerPrompt`, clarifying that keybindings often suggest alternate commands. I'm now actively investigating the best fit for "chat," considering `composer.openAsPane` based on its keybinding, though the markdown file gives conflicting info. I've left "compose full" unmapped, prioritizing documentation's guidance.


**Finalizing the Command Map**

I've completed the mapping from `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to VS Code command IDs, referencing the provided markdown file.  I've cross-referenced keybindings and action descriptions to identify corresponding command IDs. For commands not documented, I've left them untouched per guidance, ensuring a clean and targeted update. This finalized map is ready for implementation, aligning spoken commands with precise VS Code actions for optimal workflow.


**Implementing the Command Map**

I've successfully mapped the commands from `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to VS Code command IDs based on the markdown file, focusing on documented commands and keybindings. I've chosen to leave the commands without corresponding mappings untouched, as per instructions. The updated mapping is now ready for integration.


**Implementing Mappings**

I've completed the command mapping process, successfully updating `custom/cursor_mac.talon`. I've implemented changes, commenting out old commands and adding new ones based on the markdown file, focusing on documented commands and keybindings. For commands not in the markdown file, I've adhered to prior guidance and left them untouched, ensuring a precise and targeted update ready for integration.


**Refining Command Integration**

I've completed a thorough mapping process, cross-referencing commands, keybindings, and the provided markdown. I've updated `custom/cursor_mac.talon`, commenting out old commands and adding new ones using `user.vscode()`.  I've carefully considered each mapping, prioritizing documented commands and keybindings and leaving unmapped commands untouched. The file is now ready for testing.


**Integrating VS Code Commands**

I've meticulously mapped the commands and their keybindings from `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to corresponding VS Code command IDs, referencing the provided markdown file. I've adhered to prior guidance, commenting out old commands and adding new ones using `user.vscode()`, focusing solely on documented commands and keybindings. The remaining commands were left untouched, and the file is ready for testing.


**Integrating VS Code Commands**

I've now mapped all the commands in `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to their VS Code IDs, using the markdown file as my guide. I've been meticulous, commenting out the old commands and adding the new ones using `user.vscode()`. I have left commands that weren't in the markdown as-is. I'm satisfied that this method ensures a correct update.


**Updating Command Mappings**

I've meticulously mapped voice commands to VS Code IDs, following the provided markdown. I've updated `custom/cursor_mac.talon`, inserting `user.vscode()` for mapped commands while preserving the original keybindings as comments. Unmapped commands remain untouched, per the plan.


</details></think>

Based on my findings, `user.vscode("COMMAND_ID")` is the correct action to call a command by its ID. I will now edit `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to update the commands as you requested. I will comment out the old keyboard shortcuts and replace them with the corresponding command IDs you provided. Commands not found in your list will be left unchanged.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting Implementation of Change**

I noticed an oversight in the model's application of my instructions. While it added the new line, it didn't comment out the `chat cancel` keybinding as intended. I'm going to re-apply the changes using the reapply tool to rectify this and ensure the modifications are precisely as I specified. The rest of the modifications look largely correct, aside from that one small adjustment needed.


**Refining the Application**

I've discovered the model missed a crucial detail: commenting out the existing `chat cancel` binding. It implemented the addition but overlooked the removal instruction. The system will be reapplied, ensuring the `chat cancel` binding is commented out as requested. The other parts of the change seem fine for now, except for this important oversight. Let's see if this ensures the change is correct.
