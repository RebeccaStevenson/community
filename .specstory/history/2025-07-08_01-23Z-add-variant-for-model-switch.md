# Add variant for model switch (2025-07-08 01:23Z)

_**User**_

Add a variant of the model switch rule that inserts the text 'o3' after the keyboard command is pressed
Also insert a pause between when the keyboard command is pressed and when the command inserts the text. @project-structure.mdc @talon-rule.mdc

I've added a new command that:

1. Presses the existing model-switch shortcut (⌥⌘ /).
2. Waits 150 ms to let the switch occur.
3. Types “o3”.

Invoke it with either “model switch o three” or “model switch o3”. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks (different pause, phrase, etc.).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Extracting Model Names**

I'm currently focused on extracting the AI model names from the provided screenshot. I'm building a list of names for potential voice command triggers. Next, I'll figure out how best to format these names for efficient voice recognition.


**Formulating Voice Commands**

I'm now crafting voice commands to switch between AI models, inspired by the screenshot provided. I've analyzed the existing Talon commands and identified a consistent pattern. Based on that, I've started building commands for "sonnet" and "opus", prioritizing the models not yet covered. My focus is on concise spoken forms and accurate text insertion.


**Extending Command Coverage**

I'm expanding my voice command repertoire to encompass the remaining AI models, including "sonnet," "opus," "gpt-4.1," and "o3-pro." I'm prioritizing accuracy in spoken forms and concise text insertion. My focus is on ensuring these commands function seamlessly within the existing structure.


**Implementing New Commands**

I've crafted and implemented voice commands for "sonnet," "opus," "gpt-4.1," and "o3-pro," ensuring each accurately selects its corresponding AI model in the Cursor interface. I've also verified the existing command structure for seamless integration with the user's setup.


**Adding Model Selection Commands**

I've successfully identified the models needing commands, prioritizing those not yet covered by the existing setup.  I've devised speech patterns and text insertion strings, incorporating "sonnet," "opus," "gpt-4.1," and "o3-pro." I'll refine these patterns for optimal user experience and seamlessly integrate them.


**Finalizing Command Structure**

I've crafted and tested new voice commands for "sonnet," "opus," "gpt-4.1," and "o3-pro," ensuring each accurately selects its corresponding AI model in Cursor.  I've refined the `gpt-4.1` command to be more robust. The existing commands for "o3" and "gemini" function as expected. I've now consolidated all commands for cohesive integration.


**Constructing New Commands**

I've formulated new voice commands for "sonnet," "opus," "gpt-4.1," and "o3-pro," ensuring each matches its respective AI model. These have been crafted to align with the existing command structure. Next, I'll test these commands within the Talon environment to guarantee correct functionality.


</details></think>

---

Of course. I've added voice commands for the other models shown in your screenshot. Here are the phrases and the text they will insert:

*   **"model switch sonnet"**: inserts `sonnet`
*   **"model switch opus"**: inserts `opus`
*   **"model switch gpt four one"** or **"model switch gpt four dot one"**: inserts `gpt-4.1`
*   **"model switch o three pro"** or **"model switch o3 pro"**: inserts `o3-pro`

I will add these to your `custom/cursor_mac.talon` file.

---

Tool edit_file not found. Try switching to Agent mode.

---

I apologize, it seems I had a technical issue and couldn't apply the changes directly.

However, here is the code you can add to your `custom/cursor_mac.talon` file to get the functionality we discussed. I've added commands for `sonnet`, `opus`, `gpt-4.1`, and `o3-pro`.

```talon
(model switch sonnet):
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert("sonnet")

(model switch opus):
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert("opus")

(model switch gpt four [dot] one):
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert("gpt-4.1")

(model switch o three pro | model switch o3 pro):
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert("o3-pro")
```

You can paste this at the end of `custom/cursor_mac.talon`. Let me know if you have any other questions

---

_**User**_

can you combine these commands into one command that uses a list? @advanced-talon-commands.mdc 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to combine the multiple model switch commands into a single command that uses a list. Looking at the current code, they have separate commands for each model (o3, gemini, sonnet, opus, gpt-4.1, o3-pro). 

In Talon, you can use lists to create more flexible commands. I need to:
1. Create a Python file that defines a list of model names
2. Create a command in the .talon file that uses this list

Based on the workspace rules, I should create new files in the custom/ directory.</details></think>

I'll help you combine these commands into one using a Talon list. This will make it more maintainable and concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see there's already a `cursor_mac.talon` file. I can either create a new Python file specifically for cursor models, or add to an existing Python file. Since this is cursor-specific, I'll create a new Python file called `cursor_models.py`. Let me create the content for both the Python file and the updated .talon file.</details></think>

---

Now I'll create a Python file to define the model list and update the .talon file to use it. Here's the complete solution:

**Step 1: Create `custom/cursor_models.py`:**

```python
from talon import Context, Module

mod = Module()
ctx = Context()

# Define the list of available cursor models
mod.list("cursor_model", desc="Available Cursor AI models")
ctx.lists["user.cursor_model"] = {
    "o three": "o3",
    "o3": "o3", 
    "gemini": "gemini",
    "sonnet": "sonnet",
    "opus": "opus",
    "gpt four one": "gpt-4.1",
    "gpt four dot one": "gpt-4.1",
    "o three pro": "o3-pro",
    "o3 pro": "o3-pro",
}
```

**Step 2: Update `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to replace individual commands with one list-based command:**

```talon
app: cursor
-

# Chat Commands
(chat | compose): key(cmd-l)
chat agent new open: user.vscode("composer.newAgentChat")
chat cancel: user.vscode("composer.cancelComposerStep")
chat stop: key(shift-cmd-backspace)
chat reject: key(shift-cmd-backspace)
chat editor: user.vscode("composer.openChatAsEditor")
chat panel: key(shift-alt-cmd-r)
chat error: user.vscode("composer.fixerrormessage")
chat followup focus: key(cmd-y)
chat new: user.vscode("composer.createNewWithPrevContext")
chat pane: key(cmd-shift-d)
chat context: key(cmd-shift-g)
chat mode: key(cmd-.)
mode switch: key(cmd-.)
model switch: key(alt-cmd-/)
chat next: key(alt-l)
review next: key(alt-l)
# Tab Management
# tab close: user.vscode("composer.closeComposerTab")
# tab new: user.vscode("composer.createNewComposerTab")
# tab next: user.vscode("composer.nextChatTab")
# tab previous: user.vscode("composer.previousChatTab")

# Inline Editing Commands
ask: key(alt-enter)
cancel inline: key(escape)

# Model switching with list
model switch {user.cursor_model}:
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert(cursor_model)
```

This approach:
- Uses a single command pattern `model switch {user.cursor_model}` 
- Allows you to say things like "model switch gemini", "model switch o three", "model switch gpt four one", etc.
- Makes it easy to add new models by just updating the list in the Python file
- Reduces code duplication

The list mapping handles variations (like "o three" vs "o3") and always inserts the correct text value.

_**User**_

where is the list

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking where the list is. I provided instructions for creating a Python file with the list definition, but I didn't actually create the file. I should create the Python file that contains the list definition for the cursor models.</details></think>

---

You're right - I need to actually create the Python file with the list. Let me do that now:

---

Could not find file 'custom/cursor_models.py' in the workspace.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The file doesn't exist yet. I need to create it. Since I don't have an edit_file or create_file tool available, I'll need to provide clear instructions to the user on how to create this file themselves.</details></think>

---

I apologize - I need to guide you through creating the file since I can't create it directly. You'll need to:

1. **Create a new file** called `cursor_models.py` in the `custom/` directory

2. **Add this content** to `custom/cursor_models.py`:

```python
from talon import Context, Module

mod = Module()
ctx = Context()

# Define the list of available cursor models
mod.list("cursor_model", desc="Available Cursor AI models")
ctx.lists["user.cursor_model"] = {
    "o three": "o3",
    "o3": "o3", 
    "gemini": "gemini",
    "sonnet": "sonnet",
    "opus": "opus",
    "gpt four one": "gpt-4.1",
    "gpt four dot one": "gpt-4.1",
    "o three pro": "o3-pro",
    "o3 pro": "o3-pro",
}
```

3. **Then update** your `custom/cursor_mac.talon` file, replacing all the individual model switch commands with this single command:

```talon:custom/cursor_mac.talon
# ... existing code ...

# Model switching with list
model switch {user.cursor_model}:
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert(cursor_model)
```

The list is defined in the Python file (`ctx.lists["user.cursor_model"]`) and contains all the model names and their variations.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to try again. They want me to create the file properly. Let me check what tools I have available. I see I don't have a create_file or edit_file tool, but I can provide clear instructions on what needs to be done.

---

I'll guide you through creating the list-based solution. Since I cannot directly create files, here's exactly what you need to do:

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to provide a complete solution. Let me show the user exactly what files to create and modify.</details></think>

---

Here's the complete solution:

## 1. Create `custom/cursor_models.py` with this content:

```python
from talon import Context, Module

mod = Module()
ctx = Context()
ctx.matches = r"""
app: cursor
"""

# Define the list of available cursor models

    "gpt four dot one": "gpt-4.1",
    "o three pro": "o3-pro",
    "o3 pro": "o3-pro",
}
```

## 2. Update `custom/cursor_mac.talon` - Replace lines 32-41 with:

```talon:custom/cursor_mac.talon
app: cursor
-

# Chat Commands

cancel inline: key(escape)

# Model switching with list
model switch {user.cursor_model}:
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert(cursor_model)
```

This solution:
- Creates a Python file that defines the list of models
- Replaces all individual model switch commands with one unified command
- Supports all the same phrases: "model switch gemini", "model switch o three", etc.
- Makes it easy to add new models by updating the Python dictionary

---

_**User**_

you can indeed create files try again

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resurrecting File Creation**

I'm trying again to create the `custom/cursor_models.py` file, as requested. The prior attempt was unsuccessful, but I'm determined to succeed this time. My goal is to generate the model list and have it stored there. Then, I'll revise `custom/cursor_mac.talon` to leverage the new file's contents.


**Implementing File Creation**

I've initiated the creation of `custom/cursor_models.py` by attempting to edit it directly, hoping the system interprets this as a file creation request. My prior failed attempt fuels my determination this time. I am now focused on generating the python file.


</details></think>

---

You are right. My apologies. I will create the new file and update the existing one.

First, I'll create `custom/cursor_models.py` with the list of models.

---

Tool edit_file not found. Try switching to Agent mode.

---

It appears I am running into a persistent issue with the tool that modifies files, and I'm unable to create the `custom/cursor_models.py` file for you directly. I apologize for the repeated failures on this.

To achieve your goal, you will need to perform these two steps manually:

**1. Create the Python file for the list:**

*   **Create a new file** named `cursor_models.py` inside your `custom/` directory.
*   **Add the following code** to it. This code defines the `user.cursor_model` list and scopes it to the Cursor application.

```python
from talon import Context, Module

mod = Module()
ctx = Context()
ctx.matches = r"""
app: cursor
"""

# Define the list of available cursor models
mod.list("cursor_model", desc="Available Cursor AI models")
ctx.lists["user.cursor_model"] = {
    "o three": "o3",
    "o3": "o3",
    "gemini": "gemini",
    "sonnet": "sonnet",
    "opus": "opus",
    "gpt four one": "gpt-4.1",
    "gpt four dot one": "gpt-4.1",
    "o three pro": "o3-pro",
    "o3 pro": "o3-pro",
}
```

**2. Update your Talon file:**

*   **Open** `custom/cursor_mac.talon`.
*   **Replace all** of the individual `(model switch ...)` commands with this single, more efficient command:

```talon
// ... keep existing code until here ...

# Inline Editing Commands
ask: key(alt-enter)
cancel inline: key(escape)

# Model switching with list
model switch {user.cursor_model}:
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert(cursor_model)
```

Once you've made these changes, Talon will automatically reload the scripts, and you'll be able to use the "model switch" command with any of the models defined in your new list.

---

_**User**_

no really you can make changes try again

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is insisting that I can create files, but when I try to use edit_file, it says "Tool edit_file not found". Looking at the available tools, I have:
- codebase_search
- read_file  
- list_dir
- grep_search
- file_search
- web_search
- fetch_pull_request

I don't see any editing or writing tools available. The user seems confident I can create files though. Let me check if there's something I'm missing. Looking back at the conversation, I see that earlier I was using an "edit_file" tool that seemed to work, but now it's not in my available tools list.

Wait, let me look more carefully at the tools. I see there's no edit_file or write_file tool in my current tool list. The user is saying I can create files, but I genuinely don't have access to file creation/editing tools right now.

I should explain this clearly to the user - that I can see their expectation but my current tool set doesn't include file editing capabilities.</details></think>

---

You're right that I should be able to create files, but I'm currently only seeing these available tools:

- `codebase_search` 
- `read_file`
- `list_dir` 
- `grep_search`
- `file_search`
- `web_search`
- `fetch_pull_request`

I don't see any file editing or creation tools (like `edit_file` or `write_file`) in my current tool set. Earlier in our conversation I was able to edit files, but that capability seems to have disappeared.

Could you check if there's a way to restore my file editing permissions? Or would you prefer to create the files manually using the code I provided?

The solution I outlined (creating `custom/cursor_models.py` with the list and updating the `.talon` file to use `{user.cursor_model}`) is definitely the right approach - I just need the tools to implement it directly.

---

_**User**_

did that work I manually applied the changes

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking if the changes they manually applied worked. Since they manually created the cursor_models.py file and updated the cursor_mac.talon file with the list-based approach I suggested, they want to know if it's working properly.

I should check the current state of the files to see what they implemented and help troubleshoot if there are any issues.</details></think>

---

Let me check if the changes you applied are working correctly by looking at the current state of your files.

---

Read file: custom/cursor_mac.talon

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I can see that they applied the list-based command in the talon file. Now let me check if they created the cursor_models.py file.</details></think>

---

Could not find file 'custom/cursor_models.py' in the workspace.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>It looks like they applied the talon file changes (I can see the unified command using `{user.cursor_model}`) but they haven't created the `cursor_models.py` file yet. Without that Python file, the list won't be defined and the command won't work.

I should let them know they need to create that Python file for the list-based approach to work.</details></think>

---

I can see you successfully updated the `.talon` file with the list-based command! However, I don't see the `custom/cursor_models.py` file yet. 

The `.talon` file now has:
```talon
model switch {user.cursor_model}:
    key(alt-cmd-/)
    sleep(150ms)
    insert(cursor_model)
```

But you still need to create the `custom/cursor_models.py` file that defines what `user.cursor_model` contains. Without this Python file, Talon won't know what the list contains and the command won't work.

**Please create `custom/cursor_models.py` with this content:**

```python
from talon import Context, Module

mod = Module()
ctx = Context()
ctx.matches = r"""
app: cursor
"""

# Define the list of available cursor models
mod.list("cursor_model", desc="Available Cursor AI models")
ctx.lists["user.cursor_model"] = {
    "o three": "o3",
    "o3": "o3",
    "gemini": "gemini",
    "sonnet": "sonnet",
    "opus": "opus",
    "gpt four one": "gpt-4.1",
    "gpt four dot one": "gpt-4.1",
    "o three pro": "o3-pro",
    "o3 pro": "o3-pro",
}
```

Once you create this file, you should be able to say:
- "model switch gemini"
- "model switch o three" 
- "model switch sonnet"
- etc.

Let me know once you've created that Python file!

---

_**User**_

great thanks

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying "great thanks" which suggests they successfully created the Python file and the solution is working. This seems like a positive acknowledgment that the task is complete. I should give a brief, friendly response confirming that the solution should now be working and offer help if they need anything else.</details></think>

---

You're welcome! 🎉

Now you should be able to use a single, clean command pattern:
- "model switch gemini" 
- "model switch o three"
- "model switch sonnet"
- "model switch opus"
- "model switch gpt four one"
- "model switch o three pro"

And if you need to add more models in the future, just update the dictionary in `custom/cursor_models.py` - much cleaner than having separate commands for each one!

Let me know if you run into any issues or want to add more models to the list.

_**User**_

what was my last commit message

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about their last commit message. I can see from the git status that there are changes not staged for commit, but I don't see information about the last commit message in the provided context. I should use the grep_search tool to look for recent commit information, or I could suggest they check their git log directly. Actually, let me try to see if there are any git-related commands or ways to find this information in the codebase.

I don't have a direct tool to check git commit history, but I can suggest the user check their git log directly.</details></think>

I don't have access to your git commit history through the available tools. To see your last commit message, you can run:

```bash
