- under what circumstances do you need to define a module? it seems like sometimes you can just use context. is it when you define lists and actions?
- how can I access the list user.system_paths from other scripts? (see file_manager.talon) I want to be able to use system_paths.csv two define paths for other scripts (for instance opening directories in VSCode)
- for modifying action classes (with @) how do you know what exists?
- how can I switch between windows of a specific application? for instance if I wanted to go to a different instance of VSCode. 'window last' doesn't work for me
- what is a good workflow for debugging scripts? how do you use reple?

- open file script
