f-# How to add Talon Voice Commands

This project uses [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/) to control the computer with voice. Commands are defined in `.talon` files located in your Talon user directory (`~/.talon/user/`). This is in that directory.

## `.talon` Files

Voice commands are defined in files with the `.talon` file extension.

A simple command looks like this:

```talon
select everything:
    key(ctrl-a)
```

You can also have multiple commands in one file, and scope them to specific applications.

For example, [`custom/random_mac.talon`](mdc:custom/random_mac.talon) is scoped to macOS:

```talon
os: mac
-
go up: user.mouse_scroll_up()
go down: user.mouse_scroll_down()
```

The `-` separates the context matching from the commands.

## Creating new commands

1.  **Find the right file:**
    *   For general Mac commands, you can add them to [`custom/random_mac.talon`](mdc:custom/random_mac.talon).
    *   For new functionality, it is recommended to create a new file in the `custom/` directory. Workspace rules specify that new files should be in the `custom` directory.

2.  **Find the action:**
    *   Before adding a command, you need to know which action to call.
    *   You can search the codebase for similar commands to see which action they use. For example, searching for "scroll down" reveals that `user.mouse_scroll_down()` is the action for scrolling down.

3.  **Add the command:**
    *   Add the new command to your chosen `.talon` file.

## Python Scripts

For more complex commands, you might need to write some Python code. Python files can define new actions, settings, lists, and more. These can then be used from your `.talon` files. When adding new python scripts, they should be placed in the `custom/` directory.
