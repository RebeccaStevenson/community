Gelman chapter twelve multilevel models the basics

### Detailed Notes on Chapter 12: Multilevel Linear Models - The Basics

#### 12.1 Notation
- **Group-level notation:**
  - **Groups (j = 1, ..., J):** Higher-level grouping for multilevel data.
  - **Second level of grouping (k = 1, ..., K):** Further nested or crossed groupings.
  - **Group indicators (j[i]):** Indicator showing which group unit \( i \) belongs to.
- **Model Formulations:**
  - **Varying-intercept model:** \( y_i = \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i \)
  - **Varying-intercept, varying-slope model:** \( y_i = \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_{j[i]} x_i + \epsilon_i \)

#### 12.2 Partial Pooling with No Predictors
- **Partial Pooling:** A method to balance between complete pooling (ignoring group differences) and no pooling (separate analysis for each group).
  - **Complete Pooling Model:** \( y_i = \alpha + \epsilon_i \)
  - **No Pooling Model:** \( y_{ij} = \alpha_j + \epsilon_{ij} \)
  - **Partial Pooling Model:** \( y_{ij} = \alpha_j + \epsilon_{ij} \) with \( \alpha_j \) estimated as \( \alpha_j = \mu_\alpha + \eta_j \)
- **Graphical Illustration (Figure 12.1):** Shows the differences in estimates ± standard errors for county radon levels.
  - **No Pooling:** High variability for groups with fewer observations.
  - **Multilevel Analysis:** Reduces variability by shrinking estimates towards the overall mean.

#### 12.3 Partial Pooling with Predictors
- **Predictors in Multilevel Models:**
  - **Complete-Pooling Analysis:** Ignores group-level variation.
  - **No-Pooling Analysis:** Does not utilize information across groups.
  - **Multilevel Analysis:** Incorporates both individual and group-level variations.
- **Radon Example:**
  - **Model:** \( y_{ij} = \alpha_j + \beta x_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij} \) with \( \alpha_j \sim N(\gamma z_j, \sigma_\alpha^2) \)
  - **Advantages:**
- Allows for partial pooling which improves estimates by borrowing strength across groups.
- In the no-pooling model, the αj’s are set to the classical least squares estimates, which correspond to the fitted intercepts in a model run separately in each county (with the constraint that the slope coefficient equals β in all models).
- ### Multilevel Model and Soft Constraint
- αj’s assigned a probability distribution
- Mean μα and standard deviation σα estimated from data
- Distribution (12.3) pulls αj estimates toward mean μα
- Partial-pooling compromise in each county
- Limit of σα → ∞: no pooling
- Limit of σα → 0: complete-pooling estimate
- Strong pooling (solid line closer to complete pooling line) in counties with small sample sizes
- Weak pooling (solid line closer to no-pooling line) in counties containing many measurements
- Generalizing (12.1), the multilevel-modeling estimate of αj can be expressed as a weighted average of the no-pooling estimate for its group (¯ yj − β¯ xj) and the mean, μαm


#### 12.4 Quickly Fitting Multilevel Models in R
- **Function (`lmer` from `lme4` package):**
  - **Basic Syntax:** `lmer(y ~ x + (1 | group))`
  - **Model Fitting:** Fits varying-intercept models.
  - **Output:** Includes fixed effects (common coefficients) and random effects (group-level deviations).
  - **Examples:**
    - **Simple Multilevel Model:** `lmer(y ~ x + (1 | county), data = radon)`
    - **Complex Models:** Incorporating varying slopes and more complex hierarchical structures.
  - **Interpreting Results:** Understanding fixed and random effect outputs.

#### 12.5 Five Ways to Write the Same Model
- **Varying Coefficients Across Groups:**
  - **Classical Regression:** \( y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \epsilon_i \)
  - **Multilevel Model:** Allows coefficients to vary by group.
  - **Example (Radon Data):** Demonstrates varying intercepts and slopes for different counties.
- **Alternative Representations:**
  - **Separate Local Regressions:** Each group has its regression model, linked by group-level predictors.
  - **Multiple Error Terms:** Incorporating both unit-level and group-level errors.
  - **Large Regression with Correlated Errors:** Models correlations among group-level errors.

#### 12.6 Group-Level Predictors
- **Incorporating Group-Level Predictors:**
  - **Model:** \( \alpha_j \sim N(\gamma z_j, \sigma_\alpha^2) \)
  - **Advantages:** Enhances the estimation of group-level coefficients.
  - **Interpreting Coefficients:** Understanding the impact of group-level predictors on the outcome.
  - **Effectiveness of Partial Pooling:** Improved with group-level predictors, providing better estimates.

#### 12.7 Model Building and Statistical Significance
- **From Classical to Multilevel Regression:**
  - **Advantages:** Effective for hierarchical data structures.
  - **Group-Level Predictors:** Enhances partial pooling.
  - **Statistical Significance:** Applying significance testing in the context of multilevel models.

#### 12.8 Predictions for New Observations and New Groups
- **Classical Regression Prediction:**
  - **Traditional Methods:** Review of making predictions using classical regression.
- **Multilevel Model Predictions:**
  - **Existing Groups:** Predicting new observations within known groups.
  - **New Groups:** Predicting outcomes for entirely new groups.
  - **Nonlinear Predictions:** Handling complex prediction scenarios.

#### 12.9 How Many Groups and Observations Per Group Are Needed?
- **Sample Size Requirements:**
  - **Number of Groups:** Importance of having enough groups for reliable estimates.
  - **Observations per Group:** Ensuring sufficient observations within each group.
  - **Large Datasets:** Benefits and challenges with larger datasets and complex models.

### Example Details

#### Example: Radon Levels in Houses
- **Background:**
  - Radon is a carcinogen with varying levels across different houses and counties.
  - Aim: Estimate radon levels in houses across various counties.
- **Data Structure:**
  - **House-Level Data:** Radon measurements, floor type (basement/first floor).
  - **County-Level Data:** Soil uranium measurements.
- **Models:**
  - **Complete Pooling:** Ignores county differences.
  - **No Pooling:** Separate model for each county.
  - **Multilevel Model:** Combines both, using \( \alpha_j \sim N(\gamma z_j, \sigma_\alpha^2) \).
- **Results:**
  - **Complete Pooling:** Simple but ignores important group differences.
  - **No Pooling:** Accounts for differences but results in high variability for counties with few observations.
  - **Multilevel Model:** Provides more stable estimates by partially pooling information across counties.

#### Example: Education Data
- **Background:**
  - Study on student performance with data collected from multiple schools.
- **Data Structure:**
  - **Student-Level Data:** Test scores, student demographics.
  - **School-Level Data:** School characteristics (socioeconomic status, public/private).
- **Models:**
  - **Varying Intercepts:** \( y_{ij} = \alpha_j + \beta x_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij} \)

  - **Multilevel Models:** Allow for understanding both individual-level and group-level variations.
